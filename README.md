## 1. Functional reactive programming 

### Functional programming :

### What? 
```
Functional programming (often abbreviated FP) is the process of building 
software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, 
and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, 
and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast with object oriented 
programming, where application state is usually shared and colocated with methods 
in objects.

Functional programming is a programming paradigm, meaning 
that it is a way of thinking about software construction based on some 
fundamental, defining principles (listed above). Other examples of programming 
paradigms include object oriented programming and procedural programming.

### Why? 
```
CONCURRENCY AND PARALLELISM
```

### How?
With the features of functional programming paradigm, Concurrency and Parallelism comes by default. 

Below are few key features of FP

```
First-Class Functions
High-Order Functions
Pure Functions
Closures
Immutable State
